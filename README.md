[Pokemon Finder](https://find-pokemon-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This is a Pokemon Finder strictly by number. It currently holds all indexed Pokemon in the PokeAPI database. Simply type in a number bewtween 1 and 898 and it will call the correct Pokemon on the DOM with a picture, stats, and a query history. It follows the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for stats and information. It follows the [Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net/) for pictures since they were larger and a bit more detailed in my opinion. I checked many queries to make sure they lined up, but it may not be perfect since it's calling from two unrelated databases.
